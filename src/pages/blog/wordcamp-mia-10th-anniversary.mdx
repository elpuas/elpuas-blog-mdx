This Year was the 10th Anniversary of WordCamp Miami, it has a very special meaning for me since my first camp ever was #WCMIA 3 years ago, it introduce me to a marvelous community, a bunch of good friends, and WordPress knowledge.

As one of the active members of the community in Costa Rica and a WordCamp San Jose Organizer, volunteer in WordCamp Miami has teach me a lot on how to handle our community.

This year was my turn on registration table and it was a awesome to see how can they process 500 people in less than hour, the person in charge Jim Wells did a wonderful work, hopefully i can apply that on our camp this year since we are expecting at least 500 attendees.

I attend the Javascript Workshop on Friday, to learn how to apply the new WP editor aka 'Gutenberg'. The workshop was conducted by Brian Richards, with an introduction from Greg Ziółkowski Code Wrangler at Automattic, and my good friends Zac Gordon & Josh Pollock. it was very enrichful to know how Gutenberg works and how you can create your own custom blocks.

Day 1 and 2 were awesome, especially Day 2 on developers track since it was devoted entirely to Javascript, if you missed the Camp or any Track, check out WordPress TV, they will have all talks there.
