This year for the first time Costa Rica would have a Wordcamp, and iâ€™m honored to be part of the organization.

But what is Wordcamp?

WordCamp is a conference that focuses on everything WordPress. WordCamps are informal, community-organized events that are put together by WordPress users like you. Everyone from casual users to core developers participate, share ideas, and get to know each other.

As an avid user of WordPress, I can not be happier for this event, will have more than 20 lectures, 3 tracks of pure technology. we will learn together, share ideas, experiences, networking and eventually we will take a beer.

Aside from being one of the hosts of the event, also I will be giving a talk on Page Builders, which are? What do they do? they are needed? Pros and cons? Examples of Page Builders (Visual Composer, Fusion, Beaver Builder.

Join us this 5th and 6th of November, at the Faculty of Microbiology of the UCR, and learn together about technology, design and development.
