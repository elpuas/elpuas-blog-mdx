## WordPress

I'm a developer that specialize in WordPress and have been working with it for the last 10 - 12 years, I strongly believe that WordPress is a great tool for creating digital experiences, so why I change to Gatsby/MDX? the main reason expensive hosting, I have an excelent service for years at Siteground, but when the bill hits to more than $1000 a year, it hits hard. so i took the desition to stop paying expensive Hosting and move to free solution, yes a free solution with Netlify.

The flaw, WordPress needs a Database, Apache, PHP and this is not available on Netlify, so now what should be next step?

## Gatsby

I like Gatsby a lot and it was my first Real World experience with React, I been using it since 2018, so why Gtasby and not other frameworks like NextJS who's populary skyrocket lately, or simple a CRA? because Gatsby I really easy to use, offer a wide range of plugins and overall you dont't need to ba JavaScript wizard, to get up and running in not time.

## Markdown and MDX

I only write markdown on my PR's or in Trello, and more lately on Jira, it's nice easy, fast and I like it, Adding MDX allow me to use React components on my Markdown files, if you dont know what MDX is check this link: [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).

## Netlify

What's Netlify? in short Netlify makes it super easy for developers to host websites responsibly, a way that is scalable and secure. In a nutshell, Netlify creates its own kind of repository that pushes both to a Github repository and its own microservices. Then, it executes and distributes content across a wide CDN to deliver pre-built static websites to visitors.

The best thing about Netlify is that it selects the best CDN and distributes content, which results in pre-built websites that load faster than on traditional hosting networks. Instead of loading the site each time the visitor goes to a page, the visitor gets a pre-loaded version straight from the nearest geographical server, sharply reducing load times.
